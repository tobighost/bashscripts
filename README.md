## Bash Scripts

### What is Bash / Shell Scripting?

Bash (or shell) scripting is a way to automate tasks by interacting with the operating system using terminal commands and basic programming logic.

Instead of running commands one by one, you can write them in a script and execute them all at once.

Shell scripts usually have the `.sh` file extension.
