## This script dletes files if they are empty

This script checks in given directory for empty files and deletes them after confirming yes. 

I used input validation that way it will only accept a "y" as a yes and "n" as a no as an answer.

The hardest feature was the checking if they are empty files in the given directory. and if not it would display an error message.
